# Content Aggregation Webapp Demo for NextJS + AWS Amplify

## Getting Started

Once you download this repository, make sure you install all the packages it needs:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, to check out the webapp on your local machine run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The home page is hosted at `src/pages/index.tsx` (formerly `src/pages/index.js`) and the app wrapped around `src/pages/app.tsx`.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `src/pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

The project uses Typescript: `tsconfig.json` + node modules `@types/react` and `@types/node`

## NextJS â”€ Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## AWS Amplify (for deployment)

To deploy this project on AWS and take advantage of the Amplify ecosystem, it requires the [Amplify Cli](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install) and an AWS Account.

- `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` (I'd recommend you use `npm` even if you normally work with `yarn`)
- `amplify configure` (+ configuration steps on AWS's website via browser and via the console)
- `amplify init`

Some next steps:
`amplify status` will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
`amplify add <category>` will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
`amplify push` will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
`amplify console` to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
`amplify publish` will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try `amplify add api` to create a backend API and then `amplify publish` to deploy everything

## Typescript, Eslint, pretties setup

`yarn add --dev PACKAGE_NAME` or `npm install PACKAGENAME --save_dev` + installation if needed (`npx PACKAGENAME --init`) and setup (i.e. in []`.prettierrc`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html), `.prettierignore`, `eslintrc`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintignore`)

PACKAGENAMEs:

- eslint
- prettier
- eslint-config-prettier

Check out this blog as per [how and why](https://decodenatura.com/how-to-set-up-nextjs-typescript-eslint-prettier/)

For the above to work on your local IDe you might need to install the relevant plugins

## Project parts

### CSS / Styling

On this project we deleted the default styling and replaced them with [Material UI](https://www.williamkurniawan.com/blog/step-by-step-guidelines-to-implement-material-ui-in-next-js-2020)

Using the NextJS [setup example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-material-ui)

Istall package via:

- `yarn add @material-ui/core`
- `yarn add @material-ui/icons`

### Set up a default styles theme via a CSS library (MaterialUI)

Got to the [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/customization/color), head to _tools by the community_ and then to the MaterialUI theme editor. There you will be able to make a theme in a visual way, preview it live, and then download the end result as a set of CSS instructions in a JSON file.

You can then paste this into your `src/theme.ts` file.

_Dev pro tip: to quickly check out the CSS colours used in your project, find a plugin for your ID to highlight css colours_

Functions imported/used from MaterialUI:

- responsiveFontSizes()

### Add GraphQL API via AWS schema

With the AWS CLI installed, we use the `amplify add api` command to setup a graphQL API via the AWS schema setup.

Setup as default but we want "advanced settings for the GraphQL API" and "additional auth types" from the Amazon Cognito User Pool

In the `schema.graphql` file we use:

- `@model`, `@connection`, and `@key` definitions to types to create the correct types and create the required one-to-one and one-to-one relationships amongst theme. Used types:
  - Post
  - Comment
- `@auth` to create authorisation rules to read, create, and/or edit an object of a certain type (via an array of `rules`)

To commit changes to the API we use `amplify push`. We export the code when prompted to have AWS set up all the required code to leverage this API in the webapp.,

To review the AWS API we use `api console`

By default, the schema syncs to an AWS **DynamoDB** instance.

### Create Signup Form with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com)

Installed via `yarn add react-hook-form` then integrate via MateriaUI (They have [examples on how to integrate 3rd party UI libraries](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/#IntegratingwithUIlibraries).

_Dev note: To speed up typing/development, try install an ES7 React snippet plugin in your IDE to help you build functions using shortcodes? (eg 'tsrfc' for a boilerplate 'typescript react functional component')_

You can make the fields for the form using MaterialUI's [Text Field examples](https://material-ui.com/components/text-fields/#text-field) and register the inputs with [react-hook-forms](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/#Handleerrors), which can also handle errors.

All setup for a **Sign up Form** is stored in a new page: `src/pages/signup.tsx`

### Enable User Signup in the backend via Amplify

This project uses [Cognito Pool](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/emailpassword/q/platform/js/) to sign users up.

Use MateriaUI's [Snackbars](https://material-ui.com/components/snackbars/) to notify users of success/errors, which requires the package `@material-ui/lab` (`yarn add` / `npm i` + `@materialui/lab`)

Authontication on Amplify requires you to install (as usual via `yarn` or `npm`) the package `aws-amplify` as per AWS's [docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/#configure-your-application)

We use Context

## TODO

https://github.com/fpert041/Content-Aggregation-Demo-Webapp-For-NextJS-AWS

- Add AWS Authentication (via Cognito user pool) + Auth Context
- Frontend dynamic data
- ...
